# CSC869_Term_Project
The following project was based on the Kaggle dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images

The purpose of this project was to classify images of bees based on the health of their hive using a Convolutional Neural Network.
The image names and their corresponding hive health can be found in the csv file 'bee_data.csv'.

Images were manually added to train/validate/test folders at a 70:20:10 ratio.

1. To run the code, please add the zipped folder ('beehives.zip') found in the *[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yHQkN2CZ4EYUd-6dYSKSQT8c-37-Jzw4/view?usp=sharing
)* directly above to your google drive.
2. Open the code '' in Google Colaboratory.
3. To run the code with a GPU (as was done during development), go to 'Edit-> Notebook Settings -> Hardware Accelerator -> GPU' and click save. 
4. Click on 'Runtime -> Run all' to run the code. 
5. In the second cell of code, you will be asked to copy and paste a security code in, in order to mount your google drive and to access the images.
